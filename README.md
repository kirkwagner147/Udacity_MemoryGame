How The Game Works
the game is a 4 by 4 grid of cards similar to the childs memory game
the goal is to find all the matches in the quickest posible time

awarding works as follows 
3 stars  If the moves are between 0 and 10.
2 stars If the moves are between 11 and 19.
1 star If the moves are 20 or more.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched. The player could restart the game at any time by clicking on the restart icon.
